# Macropad Flutter app

This app is the UI part of my open source project called "Ninja-Macropad".

It's a flutter migrated version of my another repository 
[macropad-android-mobile](https://github.com/komura92/macropad-android-mobile)
to make this project usable for all mobile users.

During free time I will make some docs about this project to make it usable for those who want
to increase productivity level with me.

## Configuration

### Server connection configuration

To pass notifications to your PC you need to provide SSE server URL 
and select registered device (PC must be connected first) - illustrated below.

## Troubleshooting

If you get any problem with app - restart it (also remove from cache) and try again.
It can happen sometimes, especially in initial configuration step.
